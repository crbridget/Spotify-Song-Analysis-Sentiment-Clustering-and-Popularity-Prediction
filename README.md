# üéß Spotify Insight: Sentiment, Clustering & Popularity Prediction
This project analyzes Spotify song data by engineering features from song titles and audio attributes to:
- Perform sentiment analysis on song titles.
- Cluster songs by emotional tone using K-Means.
- Visualize trends with Seaborn and WordCloud.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models (Linear Regression, KNN, Random Forest) to predict song popularity based on textual and audio characteristics.

## üìÇ Project Structure
The repository includes:
- Spotify Song Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## üìä Features
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of song titles using natural language processing techniques.
- Clustering: Groups songs based on emotional tone using K-Means clustering.
- Visualization: Generates insightful visualizations with Seaborn and WordCloud to explore trends.
- Popularity Prediction: Builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict song popularity based on engineered features.
